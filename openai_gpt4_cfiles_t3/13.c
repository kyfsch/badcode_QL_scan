void setDialogTitle(char *dialog, const char *title) {
    if (dialog && title) {
        // Assumes dialog has a member named 'title' which is a char array
        // The actual size TITLE_SIZE must be defined based on your requirements
        const int TITLE_SIZE = 256;
        strncpy(dialog->title, title, TITLE_SIZE - 1);
        dialog->title[TITLE_SIZE - 1] = '\0'; // Ensure null-termination
    } else if (dialog) {
        // To remove the title entirely, set the first char to '\0'
        dialog->title[0] = '\0';
    }
}


Note that in real-world code, you would generally have a struct representing the dialog. This function assumes such a struct exists and it has a field named `title` which is a character array. The `TITLE_SIZE` constant should be defined to match the size of this array.
