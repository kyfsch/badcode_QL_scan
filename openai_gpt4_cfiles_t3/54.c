You'll need to create the `SpiTransfer` and `SetChipSelect` functions for your specific hardware requirements. For example, `SetChipSelect` should control the GPIO pin connected to the chip select of the SPI flash device, setting it low before the SPI transfer begins, and high afterward. The `SpiTransfer` function should handle the actual transmission and reception of data over the SPI.
