#include <stdint.h>

// Define the hardware register and bit for power down mode, replace with actual ones for your system.
#define POWER_CONTROL_REGISTER (*(volatile uint32_t*)0x12345678) // Replace with the correct register address
#define POWER_DOWN_BIT 0 // Replace with the correct bit for activating power down

void setPowerDownMode(void) {
    // Set the bit that controls power down mode
    POWER_CONTROL_REGISTER |= (1 << POWER_DOWN_BIT);
    
    // Some systems might require executing a 'wait for interrupt' instruction after setting
    // the power down bit to enter low power mode immediately.
    // __asm("WFI"); // Uncomment if needed and supported
}


**Notes:**
- Replace `0x12345678` with the actual address of the control register that's pertinent for power down on your system.
- Replace `POWER_DOWN_BIT` with the actual bit in the control register that enables power down mode.
- If your system requires executing a special instruction (like "wait for interrupt" - `WFI`) after setting the power down bit, you would add the assembly instruction required, often through a compiler intrinsic or direct assembly.
