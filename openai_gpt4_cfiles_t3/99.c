#include <stdint.h>

void walk_blocks(void *ba, size_t num_blocks, size_t block_size, void (*process_block)(void *)) {
    if (ba == NULL || process_block == NULL) {
        // Handle null pointer error
        return;
    }

    for (size_t i = 0; i < num_blocks; ++i) {
        void *current_block = (unsigned char *)ba + i * block_size;
        process_block(current_block);
    }
}


In this function:
- `ba` is the starting point of the blocks.
- `num_blocks` is the number of blocks to walk through.
- `block_size` is the size of each block in bytes.
- `process_block` is a callback function that is called for each block.

You would use this function like this:

c
// Example of a block processing function
void process_block(void *block) {
    // Example processing, replace with actual logic
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    // Assume each block is an integer
    int blocks[10];
    walk_blocks(blocks, 10, sizeof(blocks[0]), process_block);

    return 0;
}
