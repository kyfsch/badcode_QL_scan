#include <stdint.h> // For using standard integer types

// Assume that there are appropriate I/O memory-mapped register address macros and
// hardware specific constants that have been defined based on the hardware specifications.
// For the purpose of code example, these are defined as:
#define OMAC2_ETHERNET_CTRL_REG   (*(volatile uint32_t*)0x40008000) // Hypothetical control register for Ethernet
#define OMAC2_WAKEUP_DETECTED     (1 << 0) // Hypothetical bit position indicating wakeup detection
#define OMAC2_ETHERNET_ENABLE     (1 << 1) // Hypothetical bit position to enable Ethernet transceiver

// Function to resume the ethernet adapter on an OMAC2 device
void ResumeEthernetAdapter(void) {
    // Part 1: Set hardware to detect that it has woken up from hibernation
    OMAC2_ETHERNET_CTRL_REG |= OMAC2_WAKEUP_DETECTED;

    // Add any necessary delay or verification of wakeup detection if required by the hardware

    // Last Part: Enable the ethernet transceivers
    OMAC2_ETHERNET_CTRL_REG |= OMAC2_ETHERNET_ENABLE;

    // Add any additional logic required to fully restore Ethernet functionality
    // after coming out from hibernation, such as reinitializing the Ethernet
    // PHY, reestablishing link, or restacking the network protocol stack.
