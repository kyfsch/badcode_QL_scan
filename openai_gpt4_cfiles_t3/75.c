#include <stdint.h>

#define VLAN_ID_FIXED_VALUE 0  // The VLAN ID is fixed at 0 for any port

// Function prototype
uint16_t get_vlan_id(uint16_t port);

// Function implementation
uint16_t get_vlan_id(uint16_t port) {
    // Since the VLAN ID is always zero, just return the fixed value.
    return VLAN_ID_FIXED_VALUE;
}


Since it's specified that the VLAN ID is always zero, the function simply returns the fixed value of `VLAN_ID_FIXED_VALUE`, which is defined as `0`. This function does not actually use the `port` parameter because of the precondition that the VLAN ID is always zero, but it is provided to match a possible function signature where you might have a real implementation that would use the port value to determine the VLAN ID.
