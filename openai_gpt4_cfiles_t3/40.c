#include <stddef.h>

// Forward declaration of a hypothetical function that flushes an individual buffer.
// You need to define this function based on the specifics of 'a's buffer system.
void flush_buffer(size_t buffer_index);

// Function to flush all packet buffers belonging to 'a'.
// The number_of_buffers variable should be set to the number of buffers to flush.
void flush_packet_buffers(void) {
    const size_t number_of_buffers = 10; // Set to the actual number of buffers for 'a'.
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < number_of_buffers; ++i) {
        flush_buffer(i);
    }
}


Remember that `flush_buffer` needs to be implemented according to the specifics of the target's buffer system.
