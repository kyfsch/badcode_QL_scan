Explanation:
- We define a simple `NFC_Device` structure as an example. In a real application, this structure might contain many more fields and be defined by the NFC driver or hardware-specific code.
- We declare a global array `g_nfc_devices` of `NFC_Device` to represent a collection of NFC devices. In a real system, you might manage these devices differently.
- The function `remove_nfc_device` is provided to remove an NFC device. It performs three main actions: checking the device for validity, disabling the device through a platform-specific function, and releasing its resources.
- Implicitly, we have two dummy function prototypes `platform_disable_nfc_device` and `platform_release_nfc_resources` that should be implemented according to your actual hardware and software stack. These functions handle the specific details of disabling the NFC device and releasing any allocated resources, respectively.
- The `remove_nfc_device` function resets the passed `NFC_Device` data to zero after it's been disabled and resources have been released.
