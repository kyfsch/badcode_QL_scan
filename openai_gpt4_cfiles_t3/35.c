This function needs to be run in an environment where you have direct access to IO ports. Normally, on Unix-like systems, you need to either be running as the root user or have the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability set. Moreover, writing to IO ports is usually handled by the kernel, and drivers provide an interface for user-space programs to interact with hardware.

The `iopl()` call in the POSIX version of the code changes the I/O privilege level of the current process and can be dangerous if misused. On Windows, the intrinsic function `_out32` is used to write to a 32-bit IO port, but this is normally done within a kernel-mode driver using WDM, KMDF, or a similar framework.
