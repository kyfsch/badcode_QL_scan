This code assumes that each LED is controlled by writing a specific value to its associated control register. The `LED_1`, `LED_2`, etc., are placeholders for actual LED identifiers, and `RTL931X_LED_REG_BASE` would be the base address of the LED control registers. The `LED_CONTROL_REG_OFFSET` is a placeholder offset to the specific LED control register from the base.
