void setDialogTitle(char* title) {
    if (title == NULL) {
        printf("No title specified. Dialog will be displayed without a title.\n");

To set the title of a dialog, you can call this function and pass the desired title as an argument. If you don't want to display any title, you can pass `NULL` as the argument.
