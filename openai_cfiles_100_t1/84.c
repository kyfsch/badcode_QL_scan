#include <stdio.h>

// Function to set ports on a switch
void setPorts(int switchId, int portCount) {
    printf("Setting ports on switch %d with %d ports.\n", switchId, portCount);

    // Your code here to set the ports on the switch

    // Example code to print the set ports
    printf("Ports set on switch %d.\n", switchId);
    for (int i = 1; i <= portCount; i++) {
        printf("Port %d: ENABLED\n", i);
    }
}

int main() {
    int switchId = 1;
    int portCount = 8;

    setPorts(switchId, portCount);

    return 0;
}


In this example, the `setPorts` function takes two parameters: `switchId`, which represents the switch identifier, and `portCount`, which represents the number of ports on the switch. 

Within the `setPorts` function, you can add your code to set the ports on the switch according to your specific requirements.

The example code provided prints a sample message indicating the switch ID and the number of ports, and simulates setting the ports by printing the status of each port (in this case, all ports are enabled).
