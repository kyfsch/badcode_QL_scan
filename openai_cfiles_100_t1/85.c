In this example, the function `cleanBuffersAndQueues()` calls two separate functions, `cleanDMABuffers()` and `cleanTXQueues()`, to perform the cleaning tasks for DMA buffers and TX queues, respectively.

The `cleanDMABuffers()` function includes the code to clean the DMA buffers, which can vary depending on the specific system and requirements. In the example, it demonstrates resetting the buffer pointers to the starting address.

Similarly, the `cleanTXQueues()` function includes the code to clean the TX queues, which again can vary based on the system and requirements. In the example, it shows resetting the queue pointers to `NULL`, indicating an empty queue.
