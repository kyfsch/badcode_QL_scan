void unregister_device(void) {
    // Perform device unregistration steps here
    // ...

    // In the end, unregister the device from the kernel
    unregister_chrdev(MAJOR_NUMBER, DEVICE_NAME);
}


In this example, `unregister_chrdev` is a function provided by the Linux kernel to unregister a character device driver. `MAJOR_NUMBER` and `DEVICE_NAME` are assumed to be defined constants representing the major number and name of the device that is being unregistered.
