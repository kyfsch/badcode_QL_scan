This function assumes that the NVRAM entries are stored in a text file called "nvram.txt" and each entry is on its own line. To remove an entry, you pass the entry's name as an argument to the `removeEntryFromNVRAM` function. The function will remove all lines containing that entry name from the NVRAM file, creating a modified file without the removed entry.
