void setVlanPorts(int vlanId, int* memberPorts, int numMemberPorts, int* untagPorts, int numUntagPorts) {
    // Logic to set member ports and untag ports of the specified VLAN

    // Code to set member ports
    for(int i = 0; i < numMemberPorts; i++) {
        // Write code here to set member port (e.g., enable VLAN membership)
        // using memberPorts[i] value
    }

    // Code to set untag ports
    for(int i = 0; i < numUntagPorts; i++) {
        // Write code here to set untag port (e.g., enable VLAN untagging)
        // using untagPorts[i] value
    }
}


To use this function, you would pass the VLAN ID, an array of member ports, the number of member ports, an array of untag ports, and the number of untag ports. The function will then loop over the arrays and set the necessary configurations for each port.
