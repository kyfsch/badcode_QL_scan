void nand_write_command(volatile uint32_t* command_register, volatile uint32_t* control_lines, uint8_t command) {
    // Set control lines to the appropriate values for command mode
    *control_lines &= ~(1 << NAND_CONTROL_ALE);
    *control_lines |= (1 << NAND_CONTROL_CLE);

    // Write command to command register
    *command_register = (uint32_t)command;
}


In this example, the function `nand_write_command` takes three parameters: `command_register`, `control_lines`, and `command`. 

- `command_register` is a pointer to a volatile `uint32_t` variable that represents the NAND command register. 
- `control_lines` is a pointer to a volatile `uint32_t` variable that represents the NAND control lines, such as the Address Latch Enable (ALE) and Command Latch Enable (CLE) lines. 
- `command` is an `uint8_t` variable that represents the command to be written to the NAND device.

The function first sets the control lines to the appropriate values for command mode. In this example, I assume that `NAND_CONTROL_ALE` and `NAND_CONTROL_CLE` are defined constants representing the bit positions of the ALE and CLE control lines, respectively.

Next, the function writes the command to the command register by dereferencing the `command_register` pointer and assigning the value of `command` to it.
