In this code, `read_register()` is a function that reads the register value. You will need to replace `read_register()` with the actual function call or code that reads the register in your specific system.

You can then apply your filtering logic to the `reg_value` variable. In the code above, I have provided a simple example where if the register value is less than 1000, it does one thing, and if it is greater than or equal to 1000, it does something else.
