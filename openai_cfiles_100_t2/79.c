In order to use this function, you will need to provide the following parameters:

1. `fops` - A pointer to a `struct file_operations` object that contains the file operations for the driver. You will need to define and provide the appropriate file operations (`open`, `release`, `read`, `write`, etc.) for your specific driver.

2. `dev_name` - A string that specifies the name of the device. This will be used to create the device file under `/dev/`.

The function will return an integer value indicating the success or failure of the registration process. If the registration is successful, it will return 0. If there is an error, it will return a negative value indicating the specific error code. Additionally, any error messages will be printed using the `printk` function with the `KERN_ERR` log level.
