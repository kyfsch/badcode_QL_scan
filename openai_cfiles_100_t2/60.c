#include <stdint.h>

// Define the LED settings structure
typedef struct {
    uint8_t led_mode;
    uint8_t led_speed;
} LedSettings;

// Function to set the LED settings
void setLedSettings(LedSettings settings) {
    // Access the rtl931x chip registers and set the LED settings
    // Example code:
    // Write settings.led_mode to the corresponding register
    // Write settings.led_speed to the corresponding register
}

Note that this function is just a skeleton and doesn't include the actual code to access the rtl931x chip registers. You'll need to replace the comments with the appropriate code for your specific platform.
