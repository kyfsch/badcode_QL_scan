This function takes an unsigned integer `logicalPort` as input and returns an unsigned integer representing the corresponding physical port mask. The `NUM_PORTS` constant is used to define the number of available physical ports (e.g., 8 in this example).

Initially, we define a sample physical mask (`0x0F`) as an example value.

The function first checks if `logicalPort` is a NULL pointer (i.e., is equal to 0). If it is, it simply returns the entire physical mask.

If the `logicalPort` is not NULL, it then checks if the `logicalPort` is within the range of available ports. If it is, it sets the corresponding physical port bit in `physicalPortMask` using a bit shift operation. If `logicalPort` is bigger than the number of available ports, it sets `physicalPortMask` to 0.
