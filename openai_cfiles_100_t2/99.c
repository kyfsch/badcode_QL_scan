    int currentBlock = ba;
    
    while (currentBlock != 0) {
        // Do something with the current block

In this function, `ba` is the starting block address. The function uses a `while` loop to iterate over the blocks until the current block is 0, which indicates the end of the block chain. Inside the loop, you can perform actions on each block as needed. The `getNextBlock()` function is responsible for obtaining the next block to process.
