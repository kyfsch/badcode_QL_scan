In this function, we assume that `map` is a pointer to the BPF map structure. We use the `bpf_map_get_next_key` function to retrieve the next key in the map and `bpf_map_lookup_elem` function to lookup the value associated with each key. You can perform your desired actions with the keys and values inside the loop. Remember to increment `next_key` to move to the next key in the map.
