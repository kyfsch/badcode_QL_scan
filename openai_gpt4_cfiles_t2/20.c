Please note that this code uses inline assembly, which is compiler-specific and not part of standard C. It's also an example of dangerous and typically undesired behavior in any real-world application, and should not be replicated without a deep understanding of both the consequences and the specific environment in which it is executed.

It's crucial to mention that this example code may not work as is, especially on modern systems with stack protection and other security features. Also, in some systems writing to the stack in such a way is not possible due to strict memory access controls.
