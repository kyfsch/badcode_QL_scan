#include <stdint.h>

#define REGISTER_ADDRESS 0x12345678 // Replace with the correct register address
#define SOME_LOGIC_FILTER_MASK 0xFFFF // Replace with appropriate filter mask

// Function prototype for reading the register value (assume provided by the hardware abstraction layer or similar)
uint32_t read_register(uint32_t address);

// Applies some logic to filter the read register value
uint32_t filter_register_value(uint32_t value) {
    return value & SOME_LOGIC_FILTER_MASK;
}

// Function to read and filter a register value
int read_and_filter_register_value(uint32_t *filtered_value) {
    if (filtered_value == NULL) {
        return -1; // Error: invalid pointer
    }

    uint32_t register_value = read_register(REGISTER_ADDRESS);
    *filtered_value = filter_register_value(register_value);
    
    return 0; // Operation completed without error
}

// You would implement the read_register function based on your specific hardware, e.g.:
// uint32_t read_register(uint32_t address) {
//     // Platform/hardware-specific implementation to read a value from the register at `address`
//     // This could involve direct memory access, using device drivers, etc.
//     // Here's an example that uses direct memory access:
//     return *(volatile uint32_t *)address;
// }


Ensure that the `REGISTER_ADDRESS` and `SOME_LOGIC_FILTER_MASK` are defined according to your system's requirements. The `read_register` function implementation will depend on your specific hardware setup and how your system interacts with hardware registers. It is often provided by a hardware abstraction layer or similar in embedded systems, to ensure portability of the code across different hardware platforms.
