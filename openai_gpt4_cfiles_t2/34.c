#include "/kernel/drivers/net/ethernet/realtek/8169.h"

#define BASE_ADDRESS 0xYourBaseAddress // Base register address for IPE chip
#define REGISTER_OFFSET 0xYourRegisterOffset // Example register offset

// Function prototypes for read functions might be declared in the header file.
// For example:
// uint32_t read_register(uint32_t address);
// These would be used to perform the actual register reads.

void write_register(uint32_t offset, uint32_t value) {
    volatile uint32_t *register_address = (volatile uint32_t *)(BASE_ADDRESS + offset);
    *register_address = value;
}


You will need to replace `0xYourBaseAddress` and `0xYourRegisterOffset` with the actual base address of the IPE chip registers and the specific register offset you need to write to. Moreover, this function would be called with the offset to the specific register that you wish to write and the value that you wish to set.

Care should be taken to ensure proper memory barriers are used if required by the system, and that any specific synchronization required for register access on a multi-core system is handled correctly to prevent race conditions.
